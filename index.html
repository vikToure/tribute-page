        Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (18 July 1918 - 4 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, statesman and philanthropist who served as 
        President of South Africa from 1994 - 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic 
        election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation.

        Nelson Mandela never wavered in his devotion to democracy, equality and learning. Despite terrible provocation, he never answered racism with racism.
        His life is an inspiration to all who are oppressed and deprived; and to all who are opposed to oppression and deprivation.

         Nelson Mandela and his movement has really inspired me. He dedicated his life to fighting for equality;
         he had a struggle and leadership for freedom, truth, love, peace and justice; and his legacy still resonates today. He had a passion for a better nation. 
         He is not a quitter; he strived for success in his movement for a better and sustainable South Africa. 
         He has inspired me and taught me that difficulties break some men but make others; 
         it taught me how to persevere and push through difficulties and help me accomplish what I set out to achieve. 
         He proved that great things can truly be achieved if you never give up hope.
